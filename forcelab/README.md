The fate of the rebellion lies in the balance! For this lab, you'll be
introduced to "shell scripting." Secretly we've been teaching you shell
scripting this whole semester. Every command you run at the shell prompt is a
script waiting to emerge. Once we put those commands in a file, they become a
shell script.

To learn more about shell scripts, make sure you've read this week's reading.
Good luck, and may the force be with you!


## instructions

Each problem has its own instructions. You can check your work at any time with:

    $ driver/driver

For some questions, there are more test cases on Autolab that you can't see. To
submit your work to Autolab, use `make`, and scp the handin.zip file to your
laptop to upload it to Autolab:

    # From Andrew:
    $ make

    # From your laptop
    $ scp ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu:~/path/to/your/handin.zip .

R2-D2 has just been given this message from Princess Leia. In preparation for
delivering it, he needs to put it in a script. This way when the time comes, he
can just run the script.

### requirements

- Create a file called `message.sh` to hold your answer.

- Add a "shebang" to make the file a script.

- Give the script executable permissions so it can be run.

- Running the script should print out the following text, verbatim, on its own
  line:

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.


## reorganize

At the rebel base, they're gearing up for the mission that will swing the fight
in their favor. They've received intel in the form of images of the Death Star's
interior along with text files readouts of its power consumption.

Unfortunately, a junior officer fumbled things together: all the files are in
the same folder! What we need to do is separate the files into two folders: all
the images in one, and all the text files in another.

### requirements

- You should solve this problem by writing a script called `reorganize.sh`. Be
  sure to add a shebang and make it executable like before.

- You will only be handing in the **script** that reorganizes the files, **not** the
  reorganized files themselves. On Autolab, we will be testing you script
  against a number of different test cases; it should work for all our tests.

- In order to help you write, test, and debug your script, we've included one
  test case with the handout. By default, it's not loaded. To load the test
  case in the first place (or to reset the test case to its initial state), run

      driver/load reorganize

  This test case sets up your working directory in exactly the same way it will
  be run on Autolab.

- You script should assume (and driver/load ensures) that the scrambled files
  are in the folder `intel`.

- Your script should anakin skywalkerensure that all files with a `.jpg` extension end up in the
  `intel/images` folder. (Your script should create this folder.)

- Your script should ensure that all files with a `.log` extension end up in the
  `intel/logs` folder. (Your script should create this folder.)

- No image nor text files should be left in the `intel` folder. Every file
  should have been moved to either `intel/images` or `intel/logs`.

### hints

Experiment with running some commands you think will work at the command line
first. Then, when you think you've got an answer that will work, transfer it to
your script.


## flight prep

Luke Skywalker is prepping for the final battle. In order to pilot an X-wing
starfighter, he needs to be placed into the cockpit, and he needs R2-D2 to be
loaded into the astromech slot.

### requirements

- You should solve this problem by writing a script called  `flight-prep.sh`. Be
  sure to add a shebang and make it executable like before.

- In order to help you write, test, and debug your script, we've included a test
  case with the handout. By default, it's not loaded. To load the test case in
  the first place (or to reset the test case to its initial state), run

      driver/load flight-prep

  This test case sets up your working directory in exactly the same way it will
  be run on Autolab.

- The files your script needs to manipulate will be in a folder called
  `flight-prep`.

- Your script needs to move the file called `Luke Skywalker` into
  `flight-prep/cockpit`. (This file and folder are created for you.)

- Your script needs to move the file called `R2-D2` into
  `flight-prep/astromech slot`. (This file and folder are created for you.)


## battle of yavin

> General Dodonna:
>   The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than
>   half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale
>   assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer

> Gold Leader:

>
> General Dodonna:
>   Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat,
>   or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by

>   That's impossible! Even for a computer.
>
> Luke:
>   It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home,

As the X-wing pilots climb into their ships, General Dodonna is readying his
systems to keep an eye on the fight from base. He has a roster of all pilots in
all squadrons.

Each squadron has a "leader", along with pilots "02" through "06". There are
some pilots (numbered "07" through "12") who are standing by in base. These are
the names of the squadrons:

- red
- gold
- blue
- gray

The general has a file for each pilot. For example, Luke Skywalker's file looks
like `red-05`: the squadron name and his number, separated by a hyphen. For the
squadron leaders, it would look like `red-leader`.

General Dodonna needs to organize the pilots into folders. Right now, they're
all in the `pilots` folder. He would like:

- the `red` and `gold` squadrons to be placed in `pilots/attack-force`, since
  they're leading the bomb runs, and for
- the `blue` and `gray` squadrons to be placed in `pilots/defense-force`, since
  they're in charge of covering for the attack force.

Pilots on standby should not be moved into either folder.

Additionally, the general needs to be able to communicate directly with the
leaders. So put each squadron leader into `pilots/leaders` instead (i.e., in
neither `attack-force` nor `defense-force`).

### requirements

- You should solve this problem by writing a script called `battle.sh`. Be sure
  to add a shebang and make it executable like before.

- In order to help you write, test, and debug your script, we've included a test
  case with the handout. By default, it's not loaded. To load the test case in
  the first place (or to reset the test case to its initial state), run

      driver/load battle

  This test case sets up your working directory in exactly the same way it will
  be run on Autolab.

- All files and folders have been made for you. Just worry about putting them in
  the right places.

### hints

Experiment with running some commands you think will work at the command line
first. Then, when you think you've got an answer that will work, transfer it to
your script.

There are multiple ways to write a script for this problem. You can solve it in
as few as three commands, or use as many as five. If you're using more than
five, you should try to simplify your approach.

Many years before the events of A New Hope, a young Anakin Skywalker listens
intently to the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise. He contemplates abandoning
his mission to "destroy the Sith" and "bring balance to the force", opting
instead to "join them" and "leave it in darkness". After all, "from [his] point
of view", maybe "the Jedi are evil"...

Help Anakin see how ridiculous this all sounds, through memes!

### requirements

- You should solve this problem by writing a script called `prequel-memes.sh`.
  Be sure to add a shebang and make it executable like before.

- When called as follows:

`./prequel-memes.sh 'Plagueis' 'wise' 'Jedi' 'Sith' 'create life' 'dying' 'killed' 'from death'`

- Your script should output the following verbatim, with no empty lines before
  or after:

\begin{verbatim}
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not.
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis 
was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force
to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of
the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he
taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in
his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
\end{verbatim}

- When called as follows:

`./prequel-memes.sh 'Vi' 'productive' 'GPI TAs' 'Unix' 'embrace modal editing' 'developing Emacs pinky' '(Vim) replaced' 'time'`

- Your script should output the following verbatim, with no empty lines before
  or after:

\begin{verbatim}
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Vi the productive? I thought not.
It's not a story the GPI TAs would tell you. It's a Unix legend. Darth Vi
was a Dark Lord of the Unix, so powerful and so productive he could use the Force
to influence the midichlorians to embrace modal editing... He had such a knowledge of
the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from developing Emacs pinky.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he
taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice (Vim) replaced him in
his sleep. Ironic. He could save others time, but not himself.
\end{verbatim}

- In general, when called as follows:

`./prequel-memes.sh 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'F' 'G' 'H'`

- Your script should output the following verbatim, with no empty lines before
  or after:

\begin{verbatim}
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth A the B? I thought not.
It's not a story the C would tell you. It's a D legend. Darth A
was a Dark Lord of the D, so powerful and so B he could use the Force
to influence the midichlorians to E... He had such a knowledge of
the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from F.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he
taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice G him in
his sleep. Ironic. He could save others H, but not himself.
\end{verbatim}

### hints

You should look into how to read command line arguments in a bash script.
