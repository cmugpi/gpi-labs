Harry wants to get Hedwig to send a few letters for him--actually, all the same
one. He's already written it below. Now all we need to do is cast a spell (i.e.,
a Vim command) to duplicate this message. We need it to show up three times in
total. Be sure to add a single empty line between each copy.

    Sirius,

    My studies are going well. Midterms are approaching, but I've been having
    trouble thinking about them. The Ministry of Magic is extending it's grasp
    all throughout Hogwarts. I feel like I'm running out of time to act.

    Yours,
    Harry

Now that we've got all the letters written, we need to put them in envelopes.
Unfortunately, everythings all backwards! Use cut and paste so these sentences
make sense. Try to not type out 'envelope' nor 'letter' manually!

The first envelope goes inside the first letter.
The second envelope goes inside the second letter.
The third envelope goes inside the third letter.
