Instructions: You are helping your good friend, J.K. Rowling, edit her newest book! As you read the first chapter, you see an egregious error!  She of has mixed up the Potters and the Dursleys. Now you need to swap all occurrences of Potter and Dursley. Also switch all occurrences of Harry and Dudley in the article (but not in these instructions).

Excerpt:

Nearly ten years had passed since the Potters had woken up to find their
nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun
rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the
Potters' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly
the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Potter had seen that fateful
news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really
showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures
of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -
but Harry Potter was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room
held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. 

Yet Dudley Dursley was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His
Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of
the day. 

"Up! Get up! Now!" 

Dudley woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. 

"Up!" she screeched. Dudley heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the
sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There
had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same
dream before. 

His aunt was back outside the door. 

"Are you up yet?" she demanded. 

"Nearly," said Dudley. 

"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare
let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday." 

Dudley groaned. 

"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door. 

"Nothing, nothing . . ." 

Harry's birthday - how could he have forgotten? Dudley got slowly out of bed
and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling
a spider off one of them, put them on. Dudley was used to spiders, because the
cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was
almost hidden beneath all Harry's birthday presents. It looked as though
Harry had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second
television and the racing bike. Exactly why Harry wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Dudley, as Harry was very fat and hated exercise - unless of course
it involved punching somebody. Harry's favorite punching bag was Dudley, but he
couldn't often catch him. Dudley didn't look it, but he was very fast. 

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Dudley had
always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier
than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Harry's, and
Harry was about four times bigger than he was. Dudley had a thin face, knobbly
knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together
with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Harry had punched him on
the nose. The only thing Dudley liked about his own appearance was a very thin
scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as
long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking
his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 

"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
questions." 

Don't ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Potters. 

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Dudley was turning over the bacon. 

"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
