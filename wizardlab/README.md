Welcome to WizardLab!

Before you start, make sure to pull this week's lab.

You'll need to use the magic of Vim to complete today's lab. This week's lab
consists of a number of files which you should modify according to the puzzle
in that file.

To check your work, you can run this command:

    $ driver/driver

The driver by default only tells you on what line you're wrong. To get more
information about what specifically is wrong, upload to Autolab.

As usual, before submitting your work you need to add and commit your changes.
Recall that you can add all your changes using:

  $ git add -A

Then actually commit the changes with:

  $ git commit -m "Finish wizardlab"

To submit your work to Autolab, use `make`, and scp the handin.zip file to your
laptop to upload it to Autolab:

    # From Andrew:
    $ make

    # From your laptop
    $ scp ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu:~/path/to/your/handin.zip .
