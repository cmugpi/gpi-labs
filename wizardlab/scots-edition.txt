[BONUS]
An ardent fan of the magical tales, you bought a copy of the newest edition
as soon as it came out. As you opened up the first page, you were baffled by
the unfamiliar yet English like words and phrases. You realized, in a rush,
you accidentally ordered the Scots edition. But,

No worries! The nice and kind publisher GPI-CMU has included a (s)ubsitution
manual to translate the following paragraphs of text into plain old English.
All you need is some [macro]magic from the all powerful vim. After you are
done translating, you can safely (d)iscard the lines containing the manual.

    Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, o nummer fower, Privet Loan, were prood tae
    say that they were perfectly normal, thank ye verra much. They were
    the lest fowk ye wid jalouse to be taigled up wi onythin unco or weird,
    because they jist didnae haud with havers like yon.

    Mr. Dursley wis the heidbummer o a firm cawed Grunnings, which made
    drills. He wis a muckle, beefy-boukit man with a stumpie wee craigie,
    although he did hae a verra muckle mowser. Mrs. Dursley wis thin and
    blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of craigie, which came in
    verra haundy as she spent sae much o her time keekin ower gairden fences,
    nebbin at the neebors. The Dursleys had a wee son cawed Dudley and in
    their opinion there wisnae a brawer laddie in the haill warld.
