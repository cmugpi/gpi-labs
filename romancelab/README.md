## introduction

Today, you'll be helping two longtime lovers finally get married. Charlie and
Taylor have been dating for a very long time, and Charlie feels that it's time
for them to take their relationship to the next level. However, Taylor just is
not ready. Taylor feels that Charlie just isn't putting in the necessary effort
and thinks they should wait a bit more. On top of that, Charlie cheated on Taylor
a while back, and Taylor never fully forgave him.

This lab requires some creative input from you. Feel free to create some wild
stories whenever we ask you to create a file. You may find it worthwhile in the
end :).

To get started, run the `setup.sh` script and you'll get a new git repository
named story-labs in this directory. You should do all your work in there!
If at any point you'd like to start over, running `setup.sh` again will
give you a new story-labs directory.

Every phase should be done in a single commit!

Help Charlie convince Taylor that he's ready and willing to do anything it
takes to convince Taylor to marry him.

## meet parents

Charlie needs to show Taylor that he can commit to this relationship in a
serious way. To that end, Charlie needs to meet with Taylor's parents to prove
that he is willing to put in the effort Taylor deserves.

### logistics

- Create a file named `meet-parents.md`, and write a bit about the encounter.

- Add and commit the file.

- Run the driver before continuing to ensure you did this phase correctly.

## make friends

After winning over Taylor's parents, it's time for Charlie to win over Taylor's
best friend, Ashley. They've never really gotten along, but that's only because
Charlie never made the effort. Help Charlie prove to Taylor's friend that
he is worthy of marrying Taylor.

### logistics

- Create a file named `make-friends.md`, and write a bit about the encounter.

- Add and commit the file.

- Run the driver before continuing to ensure you did this phase correctly.

## revert mistakes

Charlie knows he still hasn't fully made up for his mistakes. Help Charlie
make it up to Taylor by making it as if it never happened. Charlie knows that
Taylor will find it in her heart to forgive him.

### logistics

- Find the commit hash of a commit with the message "Charlie Cheats on Taylor"
  and revert it.

- Run the driver before continuing to ensure you did this phase correctly.

## get married

After all of that effort, Taylor realizes that Charlie is really serious
about this commitment, and is ready to merge their lives together. Help
Charlie move in with Taylor so that they can live happily ever after.

### logistics

- Merge the branch "Charlie" into "Taylor"

- To make this happen, you'll need to first switch onto the "Taylor" branch!


## conclusion

Thanks so much for helping Charlie out! They really appreciate all the help you
gave them. You can find your story in the `final-story.md` file.

### logistics

- You can make a handin by running `make` in the same directory as this file.
