Glad to have that experience behind you, you ask Charlie what his next move is.
Charlie says he is ready to propose, and thinks Taylor will say yes!

Lo' and behold, he was correct. After a beautiful wedding, the two go home
a married couple. You're quite satisfied with the relationship you helped
cultivate.
