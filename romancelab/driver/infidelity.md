Don't worry about touching anything in this file. You'll make amends through

## the incident

> "I'm just going out for some drinks with some friends"

After a few too many drinks, Charlie's decision making abilities were severely
hindered. He had no idea what the rest of this fateful night would entail.

Charlie just could not control himself; his lust was just too strong.

How could Charlie tell Taylor? He decided to keep it to himself.


## full disclosure

Charlie was acting strange for a few days, and Taylor began to think that
something was wrong.

> "Is something bothering you?"
>
> "No, I've just been feeling a little funky recently."
>
> "Is there something I can do to help?"
>
> "I don't think so. Just give me a few more days."

After a few days pass by, Charlie decides to come clean to Taylor. It's better
she knows.
