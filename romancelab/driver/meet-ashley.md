After a good night sleep, you wake up to another text from Charlie.

> "She agreed to meet me for coffee! Please come along, you know I have
> trouble making conversation!"

You know he's talking about Ashley, Taylor's best friend. She and Charlie have
never really gotten along, so you agree to be there to make sure things go
smoothly.

You meet Charlie at the local hipster coffee shop. You find him and Ashley
sitting at a table, somewhat awkwardly. You sit down and start to make
conversation with them. All of a sudden, they both seem a lot more friendly.
It seems like things are going well! Until...
