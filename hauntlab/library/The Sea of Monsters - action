They’re the childhood friend that knows your highest highs and lowest lows. They’ve been with you through thick and thin and they’re the best at keeping secrets. Whether it’s dressed up or informal, cheeseburgers have your back.And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Pure mathematics can not lie! Oh my word! Come on! Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Nice to meet you, Rose. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost.Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. I am totally against bantering. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…?
