w did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. I am totally against bantering. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…?There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
