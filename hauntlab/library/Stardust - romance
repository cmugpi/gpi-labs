Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.w did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
