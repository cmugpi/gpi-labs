Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Come along, Pond! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world? Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf.Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a gourmet brie and truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun intended.And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Pure mathematics can not lie! Oh my word! Come on! Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Nice to meet you, Rose. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost.
