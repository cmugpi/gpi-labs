Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? Boring. And I hate hotels. Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Oh my word!Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. I am totally against bantering. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking aboutâ€¦?And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Pure mathematics can not lie! Oh my word! Come on! Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Nice to meet you, Rose. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost.
