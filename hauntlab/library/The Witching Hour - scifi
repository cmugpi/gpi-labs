Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one.

Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Come along, Pond! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world? Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf.
