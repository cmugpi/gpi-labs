Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Come along, Pond! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world?
