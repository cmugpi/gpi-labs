And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Pure mathematics can not lie! Oh my word! Come on! Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Nice to meet you, Rose. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost.Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a gourmet brie and truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun intended.Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? Boring. And I hate hotels. Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Oh my word!
