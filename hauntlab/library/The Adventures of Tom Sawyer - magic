Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
