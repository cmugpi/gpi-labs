w did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing.

People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? Boring. And I hate hotels. Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Oh my word!
