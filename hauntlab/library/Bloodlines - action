Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. I am totally against bantering. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…?Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Come along, Pond! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world? Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf.Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.
