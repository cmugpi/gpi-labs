Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. I am totally against bantering. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…?Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
