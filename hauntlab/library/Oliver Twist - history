They’re the childhood friend that knows your highest highs and lowest lows. They’ve been with you through thick and thin and they’re the best at keeping secrets. Whether it’s dressed up or informal, cheeseburgers have your back.
w did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.
