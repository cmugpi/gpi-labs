Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you?

Oh my word!What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.
