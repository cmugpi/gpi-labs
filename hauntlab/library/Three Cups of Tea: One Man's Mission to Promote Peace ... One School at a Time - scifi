Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.
Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! 'Timey' what? 'Timey wimey'? Boring. And I hate hotels. Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things.

Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Come along, Pond! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world? Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf.
