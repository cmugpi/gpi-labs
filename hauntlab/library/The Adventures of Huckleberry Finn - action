Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.
Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a gourmet brie and truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun intended.
Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.
