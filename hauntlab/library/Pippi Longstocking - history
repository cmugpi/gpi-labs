Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than horror people who have not.There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both spooky and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.Sometimes we lose sight of what really matters in life. There’s something to be said for a horror brie and truffle burger paired with parmesan frites, but don’t let that make you forget about the ol’ faithful with American cheddar and a squishy bun. Lettuce remind you that cheeseburgers come in all forms - bun intended.
