Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.w did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Pure mathematics can not lie! Oh my word! Come on! Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Nice to meet you, Rose. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost.
