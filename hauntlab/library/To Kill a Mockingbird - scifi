Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Come along, Pond! You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world? Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf.Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.
