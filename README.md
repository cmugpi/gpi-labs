# gpi-labs

We'll update this repository weekly to distribute the labs for 07-131.

## Getting started

Clone this repository to your private directory on AFS by `cd`ing into your private
directory and running `git clone https://github.com/cmugpi/gpi-labs.git`.

## Updating

Every week, you can run `git pull` to get the newest lab.

## Tips

We recommend that you save your work early and often. In git, this is accomplished
by using `git add <FILES>` to add your changes, and then `git commit` to commit
them. Every lab requires you to commit your changes before you submit. Some
labs will explicitly require commits in order to progress to the next part of
the lab.

Later in the semester, we'll go over git in more detail. We do not expect you
to understand everything on day one!
