# SportsLab

Welcome to SportsLab!

This week's lab consists of a number of files which you should modify according
to the puzzle in that file. There is also an optional bonus puzzle, reformat!

To get the lab (this week and from now on), run:

    $ git pull

from within the gpi-labs directory.

To check your work, you can run this command:

    $ driver/driver

The driver by default only tells you whether you're right or wrong. To get more
information about what specifically is wrong, upload to Autolab.

Before submitting, make sure you add and commit all of your changes. `make` will
not create the handin file until you do!

To submit your work to Autolab, use `make`, and scp the handin.zip file to your
laptop to upload it to Autolab:

    # From Andrew:
    $ make

    # From your laptop
    # Mac/Linux
    $ scp ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu:~/path/to/your/handin.zip .
    # Windows:
    $ scp ANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu:~/path/to/handin.zip /mnt/c/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/
